    <h3>This has been the go-to dish I order at my local Indian restaurant so I finally just decided to recreate it at
        home and I could't be happier with the end result!</h3>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Coriander, cumin, turmeric, fennel seeds, cinnamon, pepper, ground mustard, ground cloves, cayenne pepper and salt - these spices build incredible flavor in this dish. Together they create a homemade curry blend.</li>
        <li>Olive oil - used for saut√©ing.</li>
        <li>Fresh onion, garlic and ginger - these aromatics add a key depth of flavor.</li>
        <li>Low-sodium chicken broth - to create a sauce base to coat the chicken.</li>
        <li>Canned tomatoes - fresh tomatoes will work here too but canned are quicker and easier.</li>
        <li>Chicken breasts - be careful not to over-cook so the chicken doesn't become dry.</li>
        <li>Cornstarch - used to thicken the sauce slightly.</li>
        <li>Heavy cream - this makes the sauce deliciously rich and creamy.</li>
        <li>Chopped cilantro - adds a nice prop of fresh flavor and color.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small mixing bowl whisk together all of the spices in the spice blend, set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add in onion and saute until slightly golden brown, about 4 - 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add in garlic and ginger, saute 30 seconds more then add in spice blend and saute 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Pour in chicken broth and tomatoes and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour mixture into a blender then cover with lid and remove lid insert, cover opening with a clean folded kitchen rag. </li>
        <li>Blend mixture until well pureed and smooth then return to skillet and heat skillet over medium-high heat. </li>
        <li>Season sauce with salt and cayenne pepper (start with about 1/2 tsp salt and a few dashes cayenne then add more to taste) then add in chicken.</li>
        <li>Bring to a simmer then reduce heat to medium-low, cover skillet with lid and simmer until chicken has cooked through, stirring occasionally, about 8 -  12 minutes.</li>
        <li>During the last minute of cooking stir in the cornstarch and water slurry if desired, to thicken sauce slightly (or if needed thin with a little chicken broth).</li>
        <li>Stir in cream then serve warm with cilantro over basmati rice.</li>
    </ol>
