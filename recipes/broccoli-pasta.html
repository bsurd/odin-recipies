    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>300 grams broccoli</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>

        <li>Garnish with pangrattato, extra parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice the broccoli into small florets including cutting the stems into small cubes. Boil the broccoli florets
            and stems in a large pot of salted water for about 5- 8 minutes until fork tender</li>
        <li>At the same time, dice the garlic cloves into cubes and sautee in a large pan or skillet with olive oil on a
            low heat</li>
        <li>Add the cooked broccoli to the pan with a ladle of the cooking water and stir through</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta in the same boiling water until almost cooked ( a few minutes before the provided cooking
            time on the package instructions) then drain and add to the pan with the broccoli.</li>
        <li>Add the freshly grated parmigiano cheese with a ladle of reserved pasta water and stir for a few minutes
            over a medium heat. Add more pasta water as needed to finish cooking the pasta to al dente or to desired
            consistency and to create a creamy sauce</li>
    </ol>
